I want to build a app that implements an api in Python.
In the file "BOA_Interface_Description_v0.91.md" there is a description of an API.
Please implement this API with the following notes:
- Use Python
- use FastApi
- create a doc/swagger page to document the API
- Make the doc/swagger page with a usefull input and output example
 

Please add a visible and invisible watermark to the photo. The watermark should contain the transaction id and the text "BOA APP RDW.NL". For the transaction id use the "transactie-id" that is available in the API response.

Now produce 2 files for me that I can download: 
* a planning.md file containing high-level vision, architecture, constraints, tech stack, tools, etc for this application
* a task.md file that lists all tasks needed in a bulleted list that can be used to monitor progress.
