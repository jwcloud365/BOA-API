I want to build a app that implements an api in Python.
In the file "BOA_Interface_Description_v0.91.md" there is a description of an API.
Please implement this API with the following notes:
- Use Python
- use FastApi
- create a doc/swagger page to document the API
- Make the doc/swagger page with a usefull input and output example

You must follow the planning in PLANNING.md, and you must keep track of the tasks that you need to do described in TASK.md.
Always before starting a new task, first  read PLANNING.md and TASK.md first, so you knwo where you are and you know what to do.
After completion of each task, update PLANNING.md and update TASK.md, so you know which tasks you have completed already.
When starting initially, create a Changelog.md file.
For each change that you have completed, update the Changelog.md file.
Start with creating a virtual environment for Python, and bring this repository under git version control. Then start doing your work.
